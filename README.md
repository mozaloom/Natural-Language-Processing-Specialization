## Course Overview
The Natural Language Processing Specialization covers various aspects of NLP, including text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, machine translation, named entity recognition, and more. Throughout the course, we work on practical projects to apply the concepts learned.

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `Course1-Classification/`: Materials and assignments for Course 1 - Classification and Vector Spaces
- `Course2-Probabilistic-Models/`: Materials and assignments for Course 2 - Probabilistic Models
- `Course3-Sequence-Models/`: Materials and assignments for Course 3 - Sequence Models
- `Course4-Advanced-NLP/`: Materials and assignments for Course 4 - Advanced NLP with Attention Models
- `datasets/`: Datasets used in the courses
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for the projects
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and model training

## Projects
This specialization includes several hands-on projects:
1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing the sentiment of text data using various NLP techniques.
2. **Machine Translation**: Building a machine translation system to translate text from one language to another.
3. **Named Entity Recognition**: Identifying and classifying named entities in text.
4. **Text Generation**: Generating text using language models.
